# Cities provide more opportunities for people to grow economically. However, these opportunities are unequal because of the knowledge asymmetry. How can we ensure that people have more equal and wider access to better and relevant economic opportunities/jobs? However, people's access to these opportunities varies due to various factors. We are looking for a software solution where all the relavant opportunities including jobs, tenders in public domain, freelancing work, etc. would be listed & visible. Sectors can be but not limited to Opportunities in Govenment Sector, Private Sector, Technology, Science, etc.
# solution
# We have decided to make an app that could give equal chances to both poor homemakers as well as people with cooking skills.
# This app will contain many sections but the main purpose of this app will be to provide tiffin services and catering srvices to the customers in their locality 
# Nowdays it is mostly seen that people don’t get time to cook specially working womens and hostel living students and every day they cant efford to eat hotel’s food as it will also affect their Health.
# So for them this app is going to be valuable
# In this app we are providing three categories of food based on health like diet food for people who are on dieting as well as diabetic food for diabetic patients and many more…
